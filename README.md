This repository contains my implementations of three labs from course Artificial Intelligence.
*  Alpha-Beta Pruning in the context of a strategy board game
  In this project, I write a program to determine the next optimal move in a strategy board game (Reversi). The rule of  the Reversi game can be found at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi  and interactive examples can be found at http://www.samsoft.org.uk/reversi/ . The algorithm used in the project is the Alpha-Beta algorithm， which can be considered as an improved version of the Minimax Search algorithm.

*  Logical inference to solve an SAT-problem
*  Probabilistic reasoning in a Decision Network
