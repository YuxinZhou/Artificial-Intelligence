# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains my implementations of three labs from course Artificial Intelligence.
1.  Alpha-Beta Pruning in the context of a strategy board game
* In this project, I wrote a program to determine the next optimal move in a strategy board game (Reversi). The rule of the Reversi game can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi  and interactive examples can be found at http://www.samsoft.org.uk/reversi/ . The algorithm used in the project is the Alpha-Beta algorithm， which can be considered as an improved version of the Minimax Search algorithm. Detail descriptions can be found in hw1.pdf .

2.  Logical inference to solve an SAT-problem
* This project solves a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). SAT problem determines if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula, and they are considered as NP-complete. I implement two logical inference algorithm - that is PLResolution & DPLL to determine whether there is a solution to the given problem. Also I use a local search algorithm WalkSAT to find a solution. 

3.  Probabilistic reasoning in a Decision Network
